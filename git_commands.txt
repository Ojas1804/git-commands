Initialize Repository:
(Repo. is a folder)
- git init 

See if we need to commit changes:
- git status

Commiting changes:
- git add -A     [ to add all changes to the commit stage ]
(If you added some file to the commit stage by mistake and you do not want to 
commit changes in that file so you can remove that file from the stage using):
- git restore --stages <files>

Commit changes:
- git commit -m "message"

Push changes to git:
- git push origin <branch-name>
